# PROGRAMMING PATTERNS
**Type Object**
The Vector table acts as a type object.
This allows me to create 2D vector coordinates.

**Update Method**
Each object (card, zone, player, gameObj, deck) has an update method.
The main game loop calls this update method for each object once per frame.

**Game Loop**
The functions love.update and love.draw act as the game loop.
This allows the game world to be updated and drawn every frame.
